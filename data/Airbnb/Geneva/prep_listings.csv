Je parle vietnamien, anglais, mandarin, cantonais et je commence le français.

Nous avons toujours eu des invités d'un genre ou un autre occupant nos chambres d'amis. Nous aimons avoir des invités. Nous apprécions de passer du temps avec mais ils peuvent aussi mener leur petite vie dans leur coin, comme nous avons aussi parfois besoin de tranquillité.

Nous sommes heureux de pouvoir recevoir des gens des quatre coins du monde et de partager et échanger avec eux. Nous tenterons de leur faire découvrir la vie en Suisse et les bonnes combines que nous connaissons pour profiter au mieux de notre ville.

I am French, I came to Switzerland for 2 weeks vacation and I never left for nearly 20 years. I lived in Geneva and also in Lausanne. I am a nurse, and I became nurse manager. I then shifted to run a restaurant in Geneva.

Likes: foreign languages​​, traveling, movies, reading, cooking, eat well, spend evenings with friends, meet new people, hiking.
I speak French, English, Spanish, German I'm doing and I understand Italian.

I love to cook, so if you come at the right time, I may have been baking and you'll get to share with a cup of tea or coffee or vietnamese coffee.

I am Vietnamese, I arrived in Switzerland in November 2012. I'm learning French at the moment I'm not working.
I love Vietnamese food, play tennis on PS3, cinema, sea, meet people, the countryside, out with friends, traveling.
I speak Vietnamese, English, Mandarin, Cantonese and I started the French.

We've had guests of one kind or another occupying my spare rooms for most of life - I enjoy having guests, and love to entertain, but we can appreciate giving people their own quiet space as we also need our own privacy.
We are happy to hear from people around the world to share and exchange with them. We try to introduce them to life in Switzerland.

Je suis français, je suis venu en Suisse pour 2 semaines de vacances et je ne suis jamais reparti depuis plus de 20 ans. J'ai vécu à Genève et aussi à Lausanne. Je suis infirmier de formation, puis je suis devenu cadre de soins. Je me suis ensuite réorienté pour diriger un restaurant à Genève.
Aujourd'hui je donne un nouveau souffle à ma carrière pour les années à venir.
J'aime: les langues étrangères, voyager, les films, la lecture, la cuisine, bien manger, passer des soirées entre amis, faire de nouvelles rencontres, la randonnée.
Je parle français , anglais, espagnol, je me débrouille en allemand et je comprends l'italien.
J'aime cuisiner, donc si vous venez au bon moment, j'ai peut-être un plat en préparation et vous aurez la chance de le partager avec nous.

Xuong:
Je suis vietnamien, je suis arrivé en Suisse en novembre 2012. J'apprends le français, pour le moment je ne travaille pas.
J'aime la cuisine vietnamienne, jouer au tennis sur PS3, le cinéma, la mer, rencontrer du monde, la campagne, sortir avec des amis, voyager.
Je parle vietnamien, anglais, mandarin, cantonais et je commence le français.

Nous avons toujours eu des invités d'un genre ou un autre occupant nos chambres d'amis. Nous aimons avoir des invités. Nous apprécions de passer du temps avec mais ils peuvent aussi mener leur petite vie dans leur coin, comme nous avons aussi parfois besoin de tranquillité.

Nous sommes heureux de pouvoir recevoir des gens des quatre coins du monde et de partager et échanger avec eux. Nous tenterons de leur faire découvrir la vie en Suisse et les bonnes combines que nous connaissons pour profiter au mieux de notre ville.

GLBT bienvenus

Jean-Philippe:
I am French, I came to Switzerland for 2 weeks vacation and I never left for nearly 20 years. I lived in Geneva and also in Lausanne. I am a nurse, and I became nurse manager. I then shifted to run a restaurant in Geneva.
Today I give a new life to my career for years to come.
Likes: foreign languages​​, traveling, movies, reading, cooking, eat well, spend evenings with friends, meet new people, hiking.
I speak French, English, Spanish, German I'm doing and I understand Italian.

I love to cook, so if you come at the right time, I may have been baking and you'll get to share with a cup of tea or coffee or vietnamese coffee.

Xuong:
I am Vietnamese, I arrived in Switzerland in November 2012. I'm learning French at the moment I'm not working.
I love Vietnamese food, play tennis on PS3, cinema, sea, meet people, the countryside, out with friends, traveling.
I speak Vietnamese, English, Mandarin, Cantonese and I started the French.

We've had guests of one kind or another occupying my spare rooms for most of life - I enjoy having guests, and love to entertain, but we can appreciate giving people their own quiet space as we also need our own privacy.
We are happy to hear from people around the world to share and exchange with them. We try to introduce them to life in Switzerland.

We are an intercultural married professional couple in Geneva without children in the home.

We are non-smokers and light drinkers. In addition to being multicultural, you will find us to be friendly, outgoing, easy-going, extremely open-minded and very accommodating. Our home is a safe environment in every sense of the word, but also an adult environment. Although the home is large by Geneva standards, it's a compact layout where everyone is inevitably in the lives of the others. It's not well-suited to shy, introverted, or prudish persons, or to those who spend the majority of their time in their room.

We both have postgraduate degrees and a fair amount of life experience gained living and working in different places around the world. Rick now works independently and works from home when not traveling. Kelly works in private banking, in the front office for a Top-5 world-class private bank. Weeknights find us home enjoying dinner together. Friday and Saturday evenings, if at home, we may open a bottle of wine or two and enjoy a movie. Weekends are usually spent shopping, traveling, entertaining or visiting friends in the city.

We only rent to women. We prefer working professionals who either need a room while they conduct an apartment search, those on a limited housing budget or short-term contract, and those who simply do not want to live alone in a new city.

English, German, French, Portuguese and Spanish is spoken.

We encourage you to read our reviews (both given and received) and even contact past guests confidentially before reserving, and look forward to hosting you during your stay in Geneva should we be fortunate enough to share each others' company!

Rick & Kelly",within a day,100%,50%,t,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/a5f95071-1832-4992-b6b8-0cb091df790f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/a5f95071-1832-4992-b6b8-0cb091df790f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,,1,1,"['email', 'phone', 'reviews', 'jumio', 'government_id']",t,t,"Genève, Switzerland",Commune de Genève,,46.19195,6.14602,Private room in apartment,Private room,1,0.0,1.5 shared baths,1.0,1.0,"[""Microwave"", ""Cable TV"", ""Long term stays allowed"", ""Kitchen"", ""TV"", ""Coffee maker"", ""Bed linens"", ""Host greets you"", ""Oven"", ""Stove"", ""Dedicated workspace"", ""Shampoo"", ""Washer"", ""Luggage dropoff allowed"", ""Iron"", ""Hot water"", ""Extra pillows and blankets"", ""Paid parking off premises"", ""Refrigerator"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""Ethernet connection"", ""Lock on bedroom door"", ""Heating"", ""Wifi"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Dryer"", ""Dishwasher"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Hangers"", ""Essentials"", ""Cooking basics""]",$64.00,28,123,28,28,123,123,28.0,123.0,,t,29,59,89,179,2020-12-30,18,0,0,2016-06-12,2019-12-08,100.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,,f,1,0,1,0,0.32

  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
 If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too.
 If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
 Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

 If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
 If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster,
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
 If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
 Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

 If you can make a heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
 And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
 If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
 And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: ""Hold on!""

 If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
 If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
 If you can fill the unforgiving minute

Definitely check with me for amazing sunset locations, where to go for superb walks, and where to have mindblowing culinary experiences! 

I have lived in Switzerland, Paris, Shanghai and Panama, and Medellin, Colombia for work and love to discover new cultures and landscapes myself.

I will always try to meet your expectations and even go beyond the expectation of your stay. If you have any suggestions for me, please let me know!

Some great features I have are due to the inspirations of other guests that stayed with me and had interesting ideas. So please don't hesitate to let me know your thoughts.

Un troisième logement, situé en bord de mer, en Catalogne, à Ametlla-de-Mar, est également mis en location. C'est un appartement de 4 chambres pouvant accueillir 6 personnes.
Ma devise: ""La vie est une œuvre d'art très difficile, et, parti de rien, c'est déjà beaucoup que d'en réussir quelques parties, en travaillant et en économisant "".

Après quelques missions humanitaires, d'où j'ai ramené meubles et décorations, j'ai aménagé un souplex-loft dans une zone industrielle, sur la rive-droite de Genève, proche de toutes commodités. Avec mon conjoint, nous prenons plaisir à recevoir des personnes de passage à Genève. Comme j'aime m'occuper de mon jardin, j'en profite aussi pour préparer des confitures, sirops, pâtes de fruits avec des fruits du jardin.

Un troisième logement, situé en bord de mer, en Catalogne, à Ametlla-de-Mar, est également mis en location. C'est un appartement de 4 chambres pouvant accueillir 6 personnes.

With its humanitarian tradition and cosmopolitan flair, the European seat of the UNO and headquarters of the Red Cross is known as the «capital of peace».<br />The symbol of the «world’s smallest metropolis» is the “Jet d’eau” – a fountain with a 140-metre-high water jet at the periphery of Lake Geneva. Most of the large hotels and many restaurants are situated on the right-hand shore of the lake. The old town, the heart of Geneva with the shopping and business quarter, holds sway over the left- hand shore. It is dominated by St. Peter’s Cathedral, however the actual centre of the old town is the Place du Bourg-de-Four, which is the oldest square in the city. Quays, lakeside promenades, countless parks, lively side streets in the old town and elegant shops invite guests to stroll.

 Or being hated, don't give way to hating,

 If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
 If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster,
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
 If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
 Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

 If you can make a heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
 And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;

  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
 And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: ""Hold on!""

Après quelques missions humanitaires, d'où j'ai ramené meubles et décorations, j'ai aménagé un souplex-loft dans une zone industrielle, sur la rive-droite de Genève, proche de toutes commodités. Avec mon conjoint, nous prenons plaisir à recevoir des personnes de passage à Genève. Comme j'aime m'occuper de mon jardin, j'en profite aussi pour préparer des confitures, sirops, pâtes de fruits avec des fruits du jardin. Une deuxième résidence à Collex (canton de Genève), est également mise en location avec 5 chambres dans une villa mise en colocation pour des périodes de longue durée, voire â l'année. Un troisième logement, situé en bord de mer, en Catalogne, à Ametlla-de-Mar, est également mis en location. C'est un appartement de 4 chambres pouvant accueillir 6 personnes.

Il est aussi possible de louer les chambres avec accès à la cuisine et au reste de l'appartement ou de louer tout l'appartement-souplex. Après quelques missions humanitaires, d'où j'ai ramené meubles et décorations, j'ai aménagé un souplex-loft dans une zone industrielle, sur la rive-droite de Genève, proche de toutes commodités. Avec mon conjoint, nous prenons plaisir à recevoir des personnes de passage à Genève. Comme j'aime m'occuper de mon jardin, j'en profite aussi pour préparer des confitures, sirops, pâtes de fruits avec des fruits du jardin. Une deuxième résidence à Collex (canton de Genève), est également mise en location avec 5 chambres dans une villa mise en colocation pour des périodes de longue durée, voire â l'année.
